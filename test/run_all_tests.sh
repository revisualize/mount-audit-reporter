# Revision: 1
# Updated:  2026-10-06
# Purpose:  The single test entry point for this repository. CI runs exactly
#           this command, and so can you, from any directory:
#
#               bash test/run_all_tests.sh;
#
#           Exits 0 only when every suite below passed. Each suite reports
#           how many tests it executed, and a suite that executed none fails
#           the run, here and in CI alike. When TESTS_EXECUTED_FILE is set, as
#           CI sets it, each suite also appends "<label><TAB><count>" to that
#           file. Scratch output goes to one temporary directory, removed on
#           exit.
#
# Suites:
#           bats test/, counted with bats --count before it runs.
